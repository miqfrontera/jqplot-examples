# Repository with useful jqPlot examples

## What the hell is jqPlot?
It is an old library to make plots with jQuery. You can take a look to the [official website](http://www.jqplot.com/)

## Why this repository exists?
Because I use this library in some legacy projects and the documentation is ... not so good. Hard to follow, a lot of options not deeply explained, etc.

And I am a guy with bad memory so I decided to create this repo thinking in my future self. To make me easy to re-enter on
the project that uses that library with easy to run examples and for various use cases i found.

## Launch the project
It's easy. You just need to checkout the project and then open the html file with the jqPlot examples with your preferred browser.
